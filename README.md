# Snake-Basic-Game
A basic version of the classic game Snake, programmed with Java. This was an assignment given in 2019 by my former lecturer while studying in China for my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. The task was inviting, as I have a great interest in video games. I came across a few challenges that, through guidance from my lecturer and online videos and blogs, I was able to overcome.
